## Hi there, I'm Robin üëã

I'm a Software Engineer from Germany with a deep passion for solving complex problems using software, algorithms, and machine learning. 

While my professional background is in fullstack development, I dedicate my personal projects to exploring AI engineering, MLOps, and app development. I am currently looking for new opportunities in **AI Engineering** or **Fullstack Development** where I can apply my diverse skill set to build intelligent, high-impact applications.
